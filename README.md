## About Me

I am an IT professional specializing in cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps. With extensive experience in platforms such as Terraform, AWS, Azure, CI/CD, containers, Linux, firewalling, and VoIP, I enjoy building robust digital solutions and leading technical projects.

Outside of work, I love spending time outdoors—whether it's rowing at sea or skiing in the winter.
